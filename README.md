# ParkingAPI
This is a restful free car parking API that i have developed during my free time. 
I have used the following methods to create this project:
1- Code first model
2- NewtonSoft
3- AutoMapper
4- Dependency injection
5- Swagger
6-Xunit test
7-Hateoas
8- Authentication

I am aware of misspelling the solution name.
